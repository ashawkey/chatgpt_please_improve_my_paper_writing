## ChatGPT, please help to improve my paper writing!

A thin wrapper of chatgpt with a gradio interface for improving academic writing.

The initialization prompt (also rewritten with chatgpt):
```
I would like to engage your services as an academic writing consultant to improve my writing. 
I will provide you with text that requires refinement, and you will enhance it with more academic language and sentence structures.
The essence of the text should remain unaltered, including any LaTeX commands. 
I request that you provide only the improved version of the text without any further explanations.
```
